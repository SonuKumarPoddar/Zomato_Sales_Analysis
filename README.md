# Zomato_Sales_Analysis
End‑to‑end analysis of Zomato restaurant data using Python and Power BI for Solving particular business problems .Cleaned and enriched the dataset, then built an interactive dashboard to show city coverage, cuisine performance, ratings and service adoption, helping Zomato identify high‑competition cities and underused features like table booking.


# Problem statement:-

Zomato wants to understand how to improve restaurant performance and customer satisfaction across its platform, using existing listing and rating data. The company needs to know:In which cities and cuisine categories it should focus its efforts, based on where most restaurants and orders are concentrated but average ratings remain low.How much impact online delivery and table‑booking features have on customer engagement and ratings, and what share of partner restaurants have still not adopted these features.


** After all the analysis

# Solution:-

#1 Most restaurants on Zomato still do not offer online delivery or table booking, even though the analysis shows outlets with these services achieve higher average ratings and significantly more customer engagement (votes). 
Zomato needs to identify non‑adopting restaurants in key cities and design campaigns or incentives to increase activation of online delivery and booking features.


#2 Improve performance in high‑competition cities :-

A small set of cities such as New Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida contribute a very large share of restaurants and cuisines on the platform, but their average ratings remain modest. 
Zomato must help underperforming but high‑volume restaurants in these cities raise service quality, so that customer satisfaction and retention improve in the platform’s most competitive markets.

#3 Optimize cuisine mix and promotions :-

Some cuisine categories (and cuisine combinations) have many restaurants but relatively low average ratings, while other cuisines have fewer outlets yet achieve consistently higher scores. 
Zomato should use cuisine‑level performance insights to: (a) target low‑rated, high‑count cuisines with quality improvement programs, and (b) give more visibility and promotional support to high‑rated cuisines that can attract and retain valuable customers.
